My Dog Loki
Loki is my 7-year-old King Charles Cavalier. At home, he's a couch potato, claiming parts of the couch, floor, and space under the dining room chairs. But say the word "walk," and he is ready to go, ready to explore conservation areas and nature trails. When he's not out on adventures, he likes patrolling the backyard, convinced he'll finally catch one of those rabbits or squirrels (spoiler alert: he never does). He may take his time lounging around the house, but he never turns down an adventure, especially if there's a Zukes Duck Treat waiting at the end.
