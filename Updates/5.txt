How To Resist Burn-in on OLED Monitors:
1. Autohide taskbar
2. Dark mode
3. Full screen browser
4. SVP4 Pro for filling black bars (YouTube/videos)
5. No icons on desktop
6. Don't leave display unattended (turn off)
7. Run imaging cleaning every 4 hours
8. Allow monitor to-do screen-cleaning when suggested
9. Black wallpaper (or auto changing)
10. Use pixel shift on most aggressive setting
11. Use logo detection
12. Don't use max brightness
13. Limit HDR usage
14. Aggressive screen timeout (1-2 min)
15. Use HUD opacity in games (or hide)
16. Use warmer display modes (5000K) (or nightlight) (lower blue in display settings) (blue degrades faster)
17. Yellow crosshair should be most resistant to burn-in (mix of red and green) (also you can mix it up with a few colours)
